<p>为保证合法、规范使用个人人民币银行结算账户（以下简称个人银行账户），安徽农金与申请人在平等自愿的基础上，根据中国人民银行《人民币银行结算账户管理办法》及相关法律，签订本协议并共同遵守。</p>\n                <p>第一条 根据《中国人民银行关于落实个人银行账户分类管理制度的通知》要求，本协议将个人银行结算账户（不含信用卡）划分为三类，即Ⅰ类银行账户、Ⅱ类银行账户和Ⅲ类银行账户（以下分别简称Ⅰ类户、Ⅱ类户和Ⅲ类户）。</p>\n                <p>Ⅰ类银行账户：安徽农金通过Ⅰ类银行账户为申请人提供存款、购买投资理财产品等金融产品、转账、消费和缴费支付、存取现金等服务。</p>\n                <p>Ⅱ类银行账户：安徽农金通过Ⅱ类银行账户为申请人提供存款、购买投资理财产品等金融产品、限定金额的消费和缴费支付、限额向非绑定账户转出资金等服务。经柜面、自助设备加以安徽农金工作人员现场面对面确认身份的，可以办理存取现金、非绑定账户资金转入业务，可以配发银行卡实体卡片。（其中，Ⅱ类户非绑定账户转入资金、存入现金日累计限额合计为1万元，年累计限额合计为20万元；消费和缴费、向非绑定账户转出资金、取出现金日累计限额合计为1万元，年累计限额合计为20万元。发放贷款和贷款资金归还不受转账限额规定。）</p>\n                <p>Ⅲ类银行账户：安徽农金通过Ⅲ类银行账户为申请人提供限定金额的消费和缴费支付、限额向非绑定账户转出资金等服务。经柜面、自助设备加以安徽农金工作人员现场面对面确认身份的，可以办理非绑定账户资金转入业务。（其中，Ⅲ类户账户余额不得超过人民币1000元；非绑定账户资金转入日累计限额为5000元，年累计限额为10万元；消费和缴费支付、向非绑定账户转出资金日累计限额合计为5000元，年累计限额合计为10万元。）</p>\n                <p>第二条 申请人自愿选择在安徽农金开立个人银行账户，或自愿将本人已经开立的人民币活期储蓄账户转为个人银行账户，安徽农金同意为申请人开立个人银行账户，并为申请人提供个人银行账户服务。</p>\n                <p>第三条 申请人在安徽农金开立、使用和撤销个人银行账户应遵守《人民币银行结算账户管理办法》及相关法律、法规的规定。申请人使用安徽农金开立的个人银行账户办理各项业务时，还应遵守安徽农金的相关制度规定。</p>\n                <p>第四条 申请人在安徽农金开立个人银行账户，需向安徽农金提交相应的证明文件，并接受安徽农金的审核，申请人承诺所提供的开户资料真实、有效，如有伪造、欺诈，需承担法律责任。</p>\n                <p>第五条 申请人可以凭有效身份证件通过柜面开立个人银行账户,也可以通过自助设备等渠道开立。经自助设备开立Ⅰ、Ⅱ类户的，需经安徽农金工作人员现场面对面审核身份。申请人通过电子渠道非面对面为个人开立Ⅱ、Ⅲ类户，应当绑定Ⅰ类户或者信用卡账户，并验证Ⅱ、Ⅲ类户与绑定账户为同一人开立。</p>\n                <p>第六条 自2016年12月1日起，申请人在安徽农金每家法人行只能开立一个Ⅰ类户，已开立Ⅰ类户的，可开立Ⅱ类户或Ⅲ类户。</p>\n                <p>第七条 申请人可以通过柜面或者电子渠道办理Ⅱ、Ⅲ类户变更业务。电子渠道不支持办理Ⅱ、Ⅲ类户姓名、居民身份证号码变更。</p>\n                <p>第八条 对开户之日起6个月内无交易记录的个人银行账户，安徽农金根据监管规定暂停其非柜面业务，待安徽农金重新核实申请人身份后，可以恢复其业务。（交易记录是指申请人主动发起的资金类交易。申请人柜面签约银行产品视同为有交易记录，账户查询、银行计息、扣除账户年费和小额管理费等不作为交易记录。非柜面业务是指由申请人通过非柜面渠道主动发起的动账业务。）</p>\n                <p>第九条 申请人不得利用在安徽农金开立个人银行账户进行偷逃税款、逃废债务、套取现金、洗钱及其他违法犯罪活动。申请人承诺不出借、出租在安徽农金开立的个人银行账户，造成账户被司法部门冻结、扣划或被追究法律责任，由申请人自行承担责任。</p>\n                <p>第十条 申请人须按支付结算法律法规使用支付结算工具，并按安徽农金有关规定支付服务费用。</p>\n                <p>第十一条 申请人使用在安徽农金开立的个人银行账户办理个人转账收付和大额现金存取时要遵守《人民币银行结算账户管理办法》的有关规定。</p>\n                <p>第十二条
