'<p>5、每期还款本金依持卡人选择并经发卡机构批准同意的分期期数按每月为一期平均摊还。手续费依分期期数而定，' +\n    '按月收取，手续费费率以持卡人申请分期时发卡机构告知为准。发卡机构在按监管要求完成相' +\n    '关价格报备和公告等必要手续后，可调整相关手续费率。</p>' +\n    '<p>6、分期业务存续期间，当期分期入账金额及手续费不享受最低还款额待遇，须每月全额还款，' +\n    '如因持卡人未及时全额还款导致违约金、利息等相关费用需由持卡人自行承担。</p>' +\n    '<p>7、成功申请分期后，持卡人的可用信用额度根据每月实际归还的分期本金等额恢复。</p>' +\n    '<p>8、持卡人成功申请分期后，不可对已申请成功的分期付款的分期期数、金额进行更改>' +\n    '也不能对已转入分期计划的金额再次申请分期付款。</p>' +\n    '<p>9、持卡人可以通过安徽农村商业银行营业网点、网上银行等自助渠道，或致电卡片背面所示' +\n    '24小时客服热线申请提前终止已经申请成功的分期付款业务，仍须支付提前还款手续费。</p>' +\n    '<p>10、对于已经成功申请分期付款业务的交易若发生退货情况，仅在持卡人提出主动申请后，' +\n    '发卡机构才会终止其分期付款业务，持卡人已经支付的各期手续费不予退还。</p>' +\n    '<p>11、发卡机构保留不允许任何违法交易、不良信用卡账户、状态不正常的信用卡账户，' +\n    '或发卡机构因任何理由认为不适合申请分期付款业务的信用卡账户申请本业务的权利。</p>' +\n    '<p>12、持卡人的信用卡账户若在分期付款期间由于账户销户、注销卡片、' +\n    '账户被冻结等任何原因变为状态不正常，或发卡机构因任何理由认为其资信状况发生恶化，' +\n    '导致该账户不再适合进行分期付款业务，则发卡机构无须任何通知，' +\n    '该笔分期付款业务的所有剩余未还部分将于发生上述情况之时视为全部到期，' +\n    '持卡人应当一次性偿还全部剩余分期付款的本金、手续费及相关费用。</p>' +\n    '<p>13、发卡机构修改本业务条款及细则，应通过官方网站或其他相关渠道公告的方式事先通知持卡人,' +\n    '并于法定公告期满后生效，敬请持卡人留意。</p>' +\n
