     <p>Ⅱ类银行账户：安徽农金通过Ⅱ类银行账户为申请人提供存款、购买投资理财产品等金融产品、限定金额的消费和缴费支付、限额向非绑定账户转出资金等服务。经柜面、自助设备加以安徽农金工作人员现场面对面确认身份的，可以办理存取现金、非绑定账户资金转入业务，可以配发银行卡实体卡片。（其中，Ⅱ类户非绑定账户转入资金、存入现金日累计限额合计为1万元，年累计限额合计为20万元；消费和缴费、向非绑定账户转出资金、取出现金日累计限额合计为1万元，年累计限额合计为20万元。发放贷款和贷款资金归还不受转账限额规定。）</p>\n

本协议于申请人在安徽农金开立的个人银行账户存续期间有效，如申请人撤销在安徽农金开立的个人银行账户，自正式销户日起，本协议自动终止。</p>\n                <p>第十九条 根据安徽农金的相关业务规定，如果申请人在安徽农金开立的Ⅰ、Ⅱ、Ⅲ类账户连续三年未发生如存取款、转账、消费、缴费等由申请人主动发起的业务（不包括结息、代扣利息税业务），并且账户余额低于100元（含100元），安徽农金将把以上账户转入久悬账户管理，届时申请人将需要携带身份证件和账户凭证在安徽农金开户行办理久悬账户激活，方可使用该账户。</p>\n            </div>\n
