<p>为保证合法、规范使用个人人民币银行结算账户（以下简称个人银行账户），安徽农金与申请人在平等自愿的基础上，根据中国人民银行《人民币银行结算账户管理办法》及相关法律，签订本协议并共同遵守。</p>\n                <p>第一条 根据《中国人民银行关于落实个人银行账户分类管理制度的通知》要求，本协议将个人银行结算账户（不含信用卡）划分为三类，即Ⅰ类银行账户、Ⅱ类银行账户和Ⅲ类银行账户（以下分别简称Ⅰ类户、Ⅱ类户和Ⅲ类户）。</p>\n                <p>Ⅰ类银行账户：安徽农金通过Ⅰ类银行账户为申请人提供存款、购买投资理财产品等金融产品、转账、消费和缴费支付、存取现金等服务。</p>\n                <p>Ⅱ类银行账户：安徽农金通过Ⅱ类银行账户为申请人提供存款、购买投资理财产品等金融产品、限定金额的消费和缴费支付、限额向非绑定账户转出资金等服务。经柜面、自助设备加以安徽农金工作人员现场面对面确认身份的，可以办理存取现金、非绑定账户资金转入业务，可以配发银行卡实体卡片。（其中，Ⅱ类户非绑定账户转入资金、存入现金日累计限额合计为1万元，年累计限额合计为20万元；消费和缴费、向非绑定账户转出资金、取出现金日累计限额合计为1万元，年累计限额合计为20万元。发放贷款和贷款资金归还不受转账限额规定。）</p>\n                <p>Ⅲ类银行账户：安徽农金通过Ⅲ类银行账户为申请人提供限定金额的消费和缴费支付、限额向非绑定账户转出资金等服务。经柜面、自助设备加以安徽农金工作人员现场面对面确认身份的，可以办理非绑定账户资金转入业务。（其中，Ⅲ类户账户余额不得超过人民币1000元；非绑定账户资金转入日累计限额为5000元，年累计限额为10万元；消费和缴费支付、向非绑定账户转出资金日累计限额合计为5000元，年累计限额合计为10万元。）</p>\n                <p>第二条 申请人自愿选择在安徽农金开立个人银行账户，或自愿将本人已经开立的人民币活期储蓄账户转为个人银行账户，安徽农金同意为申请人开立个人银行账户，并为申请人提供个人银行账户服务。</p>\n                <p>第三条 申请人在安徽农金开立、使用和撤销个人银行账户应遵守《人民币银行结算账户管理办法》及相关法律、法规的规定。申请人使用安徽农金开立的个人银行账户办理各项业务时，还应遵守安徽农金的相关制度规定。</p>\n                <p>第四条 申请人在安徽农金开立个人银行账户，需向安徽农金提交相应的证明文件，并接受安徽农金的审核，申请人承诺所提供的开户资料真实、有效，如有伪造、欺诈，需承担法律责任。</p>\n                <p>第五条 申请人可以凭有效身份证件通过柜面开立个人银行账户,也可以通过自助设备等渠道开立。经自助设备开立Ⅰ、Ⅱ类户的，需经安徽农金工作人员现场面对面审核身份。申请人通过电子渠道非面对面为个人开立Ⅱ、Ⅲ类户，应当绑定Ⅰ类户或者信用卡账户，并验证Ⅱ、Ⅲ类户与绑定账户为同一人开立。</p>\n                <p>第六条 自2016年12月1日起，申请人在安徽农金每家法人行只能开立一个Ⅰ类户，已开立Ⅰ类户的，可开立Ⅱ类户或Ⅲ类户。</p>\n                <p>第七条 申请人可以通过柜面或者电子渠道办理Ⅱ、Ⅲ类户变更业务。电子渠道不支持办理Ⅱ、Ⅲ类户姓名、居民身份证号码变更。</p>\n                <p>第八条 对开户之日起6个月内无交易记录的个人银行账户，安徽农金根据监管规定暂停其非柜面业务，待安徽农金重新核实申请人身份后，可以恢复其业务。（交易记录是指申请人主动发起的资金类交易。申请人柜面签约银行产品视同为有交易记录，账户查询、银行计息、扣除账户年费和小额管理费等不作为交易记录。非柜面业务是指由申请人通过非柜面渠道主动发起的动账业务。）</p>\n                <p>第九条 申请人不得利用在安徽农金开立个人银行账户进行偷逃税款、逃废债务、套取现金、洗钱及其他违法犯罪活动。申请人承诺不出借、出租在安徽农金开立的个人银行账户，造成账户被司法部门冻结、扣划或被追究法律责任，由申请人自行承担责任。</p>\n                <p>第十条 申请人须按支付结算法律法规使用支付结算工具，并按安徽农金有关规定支付服务费用。</p>\n

申请人撤销在安徽农金开立的个人银行账户，必须与安徽农金核对账户存款余额，并交回各种重要空白票据及结算凭证，安徽农金核对无误后方可办理销户手续。申请人因故未交回各种重要空白票据及结算凭证的，须出具书面证明，由此而造成的损失由申请人承担。</p>\n                <p>第十三条 申请人遗失或预留个人印章的，应按《人民币银行结算账户管理办法》及安徽农金的相关制度规定，向安徽农金提供经签名确认的书面及相关证明文件。</p>\n                <p>第十四条 账户存续期间，申请人有效身份证件及身份证明文件的有效期届满的，申请人承诺及时前往安徽农金进行信息更新。如证件到期3个月内未更新相关信息的，安徽农金有权停止使用个人银行账户。因此造成资金结算账户无法正常使用或产生损失的，由申请人自行承担责任。</p>\n                <p>第十五条 申请人须定期与安徽农金核对账户，如申请人违规使用个人银行账户，安徽农金有权停止使用个人银行账户。因申请人违反《人民币银行账户管理办法》及相关法律法规规定，造成资金结算账户无法正常使用或产生损失的，由申请人自行承担责任。</p>\n                <p>第十六条
